 
Metrics and calculation code is from Chandrasekaran et al. 2024 Nature Methods paper, [original repository](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/2024_Chandrasekaran_NatureMethods/). 

Single-cell crops are located in Data Vault in `cellpainting-data/cpj1_single_cell_crops/` folder. 
Well-level profiles are expected to be in `features` folder. 

`misc/well_level_aggregation_example.py` - feature aggregation example for DINO. In principle the same applies to other deep learning methods (mind the feature dimensionality).
